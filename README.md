## Horiseon's Refactored Website

[Baron's Horiseon Refactored Website](https://iamskidd7.github.io/fun-seo-refactor/)

## Description

The refactoring of the Horiseon website occured when I edited the index.html file to remove tags with no semantic value and replace them them with semantic elements. The changed also occured in the style.css file.
